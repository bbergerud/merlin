Adult. Flies with its neck tucked in and legs trailing behind. Often appears all dark, especially from a distance and in poor light. 
Juvenile. Flies with slow, steady wingbeats, usually with its neck and head pulled back against the body. The dusky tips on the outer primaries of juveniles are often easier to see in flight. 
Juvenile. Little Blue Herons are stand-and-wait foragers, patiently watching the water with their necks extended and bills pointed downward for small fish, amphibians, or aquatic invertebrates.
