Small flycatcher with a round head. Greenish olive above with 2 pale wingbars and a thin white eyering that is often difficult to see. Note white throat. 
Breeds in shrubby wetlands or wet thickets with alders. Extremely similar to Willow Flycatcher; song is the most reliable "field mark."
Song (audible in background) is a buzzy "free beer" or "fee-bee-o," somewhat similar to Eastern Phoebe.
From the front the white throat stands out against the gray chest band. Sometimes raises crown feathers. Eyering is very thin and sometimes not visible.
