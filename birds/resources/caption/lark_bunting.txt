Female/immature. To separate from other brown, streaky songbirds, note very thick, bluish gray bill and long white patch along the folded wing.
Nonbreeding male. Large, chunky sparrow with thick bill. Nonbreeding males are dark brown and streaky, with the same large white patch in the wing that breeding males have. 
Female/immature. Large sparrow with thick bill and relatively short tail. Females and immatures are heavily streaked with brown, with white edges to the wing coverts that form a streaky white patch, especially visible in flight.
Habitat. Occurs in grasslands, prairies, sagebrush and other shrublands, desert grasslands, and stands of mesquite, hackberry, and willow.
