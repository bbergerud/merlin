Breeding adult (hendersoni). Medium-sized shorebird with a long, football-shaped body and a long straight bill. Breeding birds have variable amounts of cinnamon coloring on their bodies. Feeds with a vertical, sewing-machine-like movement of the head. 
Nonbreeding adult. Short-necked shorebird with a long bill. When foraging, looks flat-backed. Nonbreeding birds are brownish gray with barring on the flanks. 
Breeding adult. Forages by plunging its long bill deep into mud or sand, making a sewing-machine-like motion with its head. When it does this, the back usually appears fairly flat.
Juvenile. Juveniles have more extensive cinnamon color on the folded wings above the tail. Juveniles molt out of juvenile plumage on the wintering grounds, unlike Long-billed Dowitchers that molt on the breeding grounds. 
Breeding adult (griseus). In flight, white upper rump patch distinguishes it from many other shorebirds, except Long-billed Dowitchers.
Breeding adult (griseus). Plumage color is geographically variable. Those migrating through eastern North American (griseus) have pale orangish breasts and whitish bellies. 
Breeding adult (hendersoni). Plumage color is geographically variable. Those migrating through eastern and central North America (hendersoni) have darker and more extensive cinnamon underparts. 
Nonbreeding. Congregates in groups with other dowitchers during migration and winter. 
Breeding adult (griseus). Found in saltmarshes, lagoons, flooded agricultural fields, and coastal mudflats during migration and on the wintering grounds.
