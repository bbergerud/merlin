Female. Females have a black crown, a white mustache stripe, and barred flanks. Found across the boreal forest and in the mountains of western North America, particularly in recently burned forests where wood-boring insects are abundant. 
Male. Best known as a specialist in burned forests, but also forages in unburned forest, particularly on trees infested with bark beetles. 
Female. Mostly black woodpecker with single white cheek stripe and barred flanks. Wings have reduced white spotting. Like the American Three-toed Woodpecker, has 3 instead of 4 toes. 
Male. Males have a yellow crown patch, a solid black back, and barred flanks. Sometimes appears dingy gray on the underparts from feeding on soot-blackened trees.
Male. Unhurried foraging style. Typically stays in one spot for long periods, first stripping away bark and then pecking into wood-boring beetle tunnels to extract the larvae.
Female. Almost entirely black from behind, save for the small white spots on the wings and fully white outer tail feathers. 
Male. Often seems to explore for food, stopping to test the bark with a few exploratory pecks to find out whether beetle larvae lie inside.
