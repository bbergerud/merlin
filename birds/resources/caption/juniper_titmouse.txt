Plain gray bird with a prominent black eye and a feisty tuft of feathers on its head.
Often calls and sings from elevated perchesâ€”a rapid and rolling series of 5 to 15 syllables that sounds almost like a video game.
Small chickadee like songbird with a crest. Drab gray overall with a beady black eye that stands out on its plain face. 
Found in pinyon pine and juniper woodlands. Forages acrobatically with their strong feet, clinging to twigs and branches while they reach for seeds or insects.
Nests in holes in trees created naturally or excavated by woodpeckers. Also uses nest boxes.
