Adult/immature. Medium-sized heron with a long, thick neck and long, pointed bill. Well camouflaged: buffy and brown, with vertical brown stripes on its neck. 
Adult. Medium-sized heron with a long, thick neck and long, pointed bill. Note long, black patch that extends from below the eye down the side of the neck.
Adult. Produces a distinctive "pump-er-lunk" call by repeatedly inflating their throat. These low-pitched calls allow American Bitterns to communicate effectively even when blocked by dense vegetation.
Adult. In flight note dark flight feathers, pale coverts, and hunchbacked look. 
Adult. Tucks head into a hunch and slowly lifts its feet with toes spread as it walks slowly through open areas in wetlands. 
Adults. Almost exclusively occupies freshwater wetlands with tall vegetation year-round. Rarely occupies coastal tidal marshes or coastal areas with low vegetation.
Adult. Note white throat and long, black patch of feathers that extends from below the eye down the side of the neck.
Adult/immature. Flying style is similar to most other herons, with the neck retracted and legs trailing out behind, but American Bitterns have hurried and somewhat ungraceful wingbeats.
Adult/immature. When approached by potential predators, American Bitterns attempt to camouflage themselves by pointing their bill upwards, compressing their body feathers, and remaining as still as the surrounding vegetation.
