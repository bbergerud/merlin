Adult. Medium-sized raptor with broad wings. Often mistaken for a Turkey Vulture, but note large white band on tail and dark trailing edges on wings. With good looks upper bands on tail are also visible. 
Adult. Medium-sized all-dark raptor with yellow legs and bill. 
Adult. Arched wings and a "tippy" flying style makes Zone-tailed Hawks resemble Turkey Vultures in flight. However, a bold white tail band helps separate these species in the field.
Immature. Immatures have finely barred outer flight feathers and a barred tail. Immatures also show dark trailing edges on the wings. 
Immature. Perched immatures look all dark with a barred tail. 
Adult. Zone-tailed Hawks build their nests within dense mixed evergreen-deciduous forests often on north-facing mountain slopes or near cliffs adjacent to streams. 
Adult. Found in dry, semiopen country, especially deciduous or pine-oak woodlands, often nesting in tall trees along streams.
Adult with Turkey Vultures. Often soars high with Turkey Vultures (top) when banding on the tail can be difficult to see. The bird at the bottom center shows one broad white tail band indicative of Zone-tailed Hawk.
